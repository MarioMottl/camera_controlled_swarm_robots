MODEL_ERROR_NONE:       No error occured.
OBJECT_INVALID_PATH:    The path of the object file could not be found.
MATERIAL_INVALID_PATH:  The path of the material file could not be found.
MESH_PRIMITIVE_ERROR:   Either the a mesh contains multiple different primitives or the whole model contains multiple different
                        primitives if the CMP_PRIMITIVE_MODEL bit is set.
                        Note that OpenGL can only render one primitive with one render call. This model loader is designed 
                        to draw at least one mesh with one render call, or the whole model.
MODEL_DATASET_ERROR:    It is not allowed that the object file (a model) contains multiple data sets for faces. A dataset is next to the "f" command in the object file.
                        Multiple different data sets will lead to inconsistent begin numbers and counts for different types of data such as: vertices,
                        texture coordinates, normal vectors, etc. For rendering, OpenGL requieres for all types of data the same begin number and count.
