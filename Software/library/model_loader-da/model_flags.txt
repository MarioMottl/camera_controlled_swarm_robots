Model flags:
    IGNORE_VT:              Model loader will not read texture coordinates from the model file.
    IGNORE_VN:              Model loader will not read notmal vectors from the model file.
    TEXTURE_FLIP_UV:        Texture coordinates will be flipped.
    GEN_NORMALS_FLAT:       Model loader will calculate normal vectors per plane.
                            Normal vectors can not be calculated per vertex because the object file does only contain informtion about the vertices
                            of the current plane. It does not contain information about the surrounding geometry but this is
                            requiered for calculating normal vectors per vertex.
                            Note that the automatic calculation of normal vectors only works if the model file does not contain normal vectors.
    GEN_TBN:                Model loader will calculate tangent and betangent vectors. These vectors are used for normal mapping. Note that you will not get any
                            normal vectors from the mesh anymore. Since every normal vector points in the same direction you can pass it to your 
                            shaders via uniform.
    NORMAL_X:               Normal vectors will be set to the positive X direction.
    NORMAL_Y:               Normal vectors will be set to the positive Y direction.
    NORMAL_Z:               Normal vectors will be set to the positive Z direction.
                            Note if more than one flag is set, the first BIT of the three will be taken.
    DATA_COMBINED:          Model data will be saved in one huge buffer.
                            Note that one model can consist of multiple meshes. The data of all meshes will be stored in one buffer and can be accessed by
                            begin and count of the current mesh. Every mesh is defined by its start vertex and vertex count; for texture coordinates, normals,... its the same.
    CMP_PRIMITIVE_MODEL:    The whole model must have the same primitive. If this bit is not set, it allows different meshes to have different primitives.
                            If there are two different primitives either in one mesh or in the whole model, a MESH_PRIMITIVE_ERROR will be returned.
